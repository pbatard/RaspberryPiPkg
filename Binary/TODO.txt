TODO: Move this to non-osi

Notes (if you are playing with ATF, you may want to know this): 

- Linux reboot is currently broken due to an infinite loop in 16650 flush
  -> Will hopefully be fixed when https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/pull/1678
  has been applied.
- ATF commit that broke boot due to forcing a Device Tree area by default:
  5341b42ec170021a4dcde3e1bd463bb8c92cdff7 (post v2.0)
  -> Requires specifying a RPI3_PRELOADED_DTB_BASE= option when compiling ATF
- ATF commit that broke reboot due to infinite loop in serial flush:
  4f8053dd288b0f76b9f2b74c49f745116d46f97c (v1.5 -> v1.6)
  -> Requires an ATF patch
- ATF commit that remapped the BL2 address to 0x00020000
  14368498da39756b5b0bd088368963dc96a34dad (v1.5 -> v1.6)
  -> Requires an FDF update
- ATF commit that fixed freeze during Linux boot due to mailbox 3 wired to FIQ line:
  6d924ca91b4643cb4b9f88ac2edf72d097dca271 (v1.5 -> v1.6)
  -> Requires to manually patch plat/rpi3/aarch64/plat_helpers.S before this commit
